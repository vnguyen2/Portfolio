			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/photo.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Vincent Nguyen">

			<p>Vincent Nguyen here to surprise. I am learning to be a developer not only to just find a new job, but as a way to personally perserve my mind. I am a tinkerer and working through problems creates a certain satisfaction not found in many places. Aside from looking for a missing puzzle piece after putting 999 pieces together, being a developer is the next best thing.
</p>

			<p>	When I am not in my dev cave, I channel my abilities in building race cars at Boost Logic. There we push the mechancial capabilities of vehicles to the breaking point. It is a mental and physical race to produce results. It is a never ending battle between what is achieveable and a mere lightbulb thought. Are we seeing similarites to a developer or am I justifying what I would think would be a good idea for the future? I believe James Franco probably said it best, "Same same but different but still same"(The Interview).</p>
